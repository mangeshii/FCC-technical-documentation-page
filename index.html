        <p>The Amazon comprises of 2.1 million square miles, Ferro, S (2015), it houses the world largest carbon sink converting harmful emissions into clean oxygen, Natives have also began to discover new cures for many illnesses from the extensive range of different plants, Bartschi, A (2015)</p>
        <p>Around 70% of the worlds animals live within forests, with deforestation occurring many animals loose their habitats, leading to species becoming extinct.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>    The Amazon has lost about 20% of its area in the last 30-40 years.
    

</li>
          <li>Brazil alone loses an area of land about the size of Delaware every single year to deforestation.</li>

        <p>The battle for the Amazon rainforest is a daunting task. It’s a long going battle between miners, loggers, and developers against the indigenous people who call it home. It’s a battle like any battle in a war; it affects lives, families, the economy, politics, and the environment amongst other things. The main topic of this debate is the effects of the Amazon deforestation on the people who live in it, this will be the focus of this research paper.</p>
        <p>  The environmental problems of today started a long time ago, before automobiles, electricity, and the Industrial Revolution. From ancient times to present day, humans have changed the world in which they live. As population increase and technology advances, more significant and widespread problems arise. The Amazon rainforest has not been spared from this. The Amazon region has long been seen as a land of great riches.</p>

</header>
        <p>The beautiful Amazon rainforest “covers a vast area of more than two and one-half million square kilometers” (The Amazon: Its Developers, Destroyers). It is home to a wide variety of plants and animals, not found anywhere else in the world. Scientists believe that there are still many yet to be found. The Amazon is also home to many tribes who have been there for a long period of time. These tribes accommodate medicine men who know the secrets of the rainforest and the healing properties not yet discovered by scientists.</p>
        <p>Although they are many negative effects of humans in the Amazon, there are also some positive ones. Tourism is one way humans positively impact the Amazon rainforest. Tourism increases economic support for the country or nearby city. It may also to increase public appreciation of the environment and to spread awareness of environmental problems when it brings people into closer contact with the environment. Humans are also organizing groups to preserve and protect certain species living in the Amazon rainforest. Scientists are using plants from the Amazon to help cure diseases. They have also discovered they can do this through rainforest insects, and can early detect certain virus to create a cure for them.</p>

        <header class="mp"> Effects of Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest

</header>
        <p>Today, the total percentage of forest cover of the earth is approximately thirty percent (“Deforestation”). That is about nine percent of the world’s total surface. The largest rainforest is the Amazon River Basin, located in South America. The Amazon is home to many species of animals, insects, plants and trees. Many of the trees and plants in the Amazon produce about twenty percent of the oxygen on earth, and absorb carbon. However, the Amazon is decreasing in size every day due to the ongoing deforestation of the land.</p>
        <p> The Amazon is twenty percent less than it was about forty years ago (Wallace). In just about every hour to two, land that is larger than two hundred football fields put together is being cleared (Wallace). With the ongoing actions of deforestation in South America, the world could face many effects that will impact every living species.
When deforestation continues to occur, the environment in the world becomes more and more impacted by greenhouse gases.</p>

</header>
        <p>Of all of the issues that effect the planet Earth from a Global Change standpoint, one of the most visible and highly publicized is the issue of rainforest destruction. The loss of this emerald on the planet's crown will end life as we know it, if something is not done.</p>
        <p>Agriculture is an absolute necessity for human life on Earth to continue. There are too many people on the planet for existence as hunters and gatherers to work anymore. That said, it must be realized that concessions must be made to allow such food growth and production to occur. But this does not mean that another important element of life on Earth can be destroyed for it. Unfortunately, that is indeed what is occurring, at an alarming rate. The rainforests of the planet are dwindling as the land they belong on is used more and more for agriculture, all over the world. In the Amazon, ,the most commonly detrimental agricultural practice is the technique of land clearing known as Slash and Burn.

</header>
      
      <p>People have been trying to find out what role does the Amazon rainforest plays.Also there are many shifts of climate in the Amazon rainforest. Each year 28 million acres of land is burned,and cutted down causing deforestation. Killing many living species in that process.If this continues,then very many plants,and animals are going instinct in areas.</p>
        <p>The oil productions can hurt the rainforest.It says” in 2003 an oil pipline that runs through the amazon rainforest in Ecuador.”So we can see that there was a pipline going through the rainforest.That oil pipline was causeing irreparable damage to the Amazon rain forest. It didn’t benefit the rainforest at that time it was happening.</p>

        <p>Deforestation (REDD), which prides itself in coming up with solutions for reducing carbon emissions and works with government agencies to push forth these ideas. In recent years, REDD has proposed the following solution to the growing climate change problem: “Given this likely policy landscape, nations can use ILPAs to reduce emissions in two ways: first, create new ILPAs in areas facing deforestation risk now and in the foreseeable future; second, strengthen the management of existing ILPAs to reduce ongoing deforestation within and surrounding their borders (Rickets 1).” ILPA’s, or Indigenous Lands and Protected Areas, is the main focus for the proposal/policy which focuses on finding ways to reduce carbon emissions and deforestation in areas inhabited by indigenous people or wildlife. In achieving this policy, REDD can help curb the problem of global warming and reduce the effects of greenhouse gasses</p>
        <p> Indigenous people have become at the forefront of deforestation and its effects—good and bad. According to Solinge, it would not be good for the indigenous people if they started contributing to deforestation.</p>
